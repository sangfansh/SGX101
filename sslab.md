We have been actively working on SGX related research.
These research projects can be broadly classified into three different
categories: System Design, Defense, and Attack.

System Design
----

- OpenSGX:
  An open-source platform for SGX research that
  consists of a QEMU-based emulator and a
  software development kit (SDK)

- S-NFV:
  A protection scheme for network function virtualization (NFV)
  applications that uses SGX to secure the applications' internal states

- AirBox:
  A secure design of edge function platforms using SGX for ensuring
  code integrity and data confidentiality of an edge function

- SGX-Tor:
  A design of Tor that enhances the security and privacy of the protocol by
  utilizing SGX

Defense
----

- T-SGX:
  A compiler-level approach that incorporates Intel TSX to prevent SGX
  enclaves from controlled-channel attacks

- SGX-Shield:
  A software-based design of SGX enclaves that enables fine-grained
  address space layout randomization (ASLR)

Attack
----

- Branch Shadowing:
  A novel side-channel attack against SGX exploiting
  branch history states preserved across an SGX mode switch and
  last branch record (LBR)

- Dark ROP:
  A novel blind return-oriented programming (ROP) attack against SGX
  exploiting uninitialized registers across an enclave exit

- SGX-Bomb:
  A rowhammer attack against SGX resulting in processor lockdown,
  i.e., a cold reboot is necessary to use the machine again

- SGX-Bleed:
  A vulnerability that can leak uninitialized SGX memory through
  structure padding
