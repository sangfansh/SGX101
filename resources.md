A collection of study resources related to Intel SGX technology.

From Intel
----

- [SGX developer guide from Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/documentation/sgx-developer-guide).

- [This](http://tce.webee.eedev.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/10/SGX-for-Technion-TCE.pdf) is a comprehensive introduction of SGX presented by Dror Caspi from Intel in Israel Institute of Technology.

- [Introducing the Intel® Software Guard Extensions Tutorial Series](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introducing-the-intel-software-guard-extensions-tutorial-series) is a set of tutorial blogs provided by Intel, which is focused on developing SGX applications for Windows platform.

- [This blog form Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2016/06/10/overview-of-intel-software-guard-extensions-instructions-and-data-structures) provides the overview of the instructions and data structures used in SGX. It's useful as a reference for technical terms.

- [This blog from Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/code-sample-intel-software-guard-extensions-remote-attestation-end-to-end-example) explains the Remote Attestation code example provided by Intel. Note that the code example from SGX SDK does not include the actual provisioning process with Intel Attestation Service.

- [Innovative Technology for CPU Based Attestation and Sealing](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/innovative-technology-for-cpu-based-attestation-and-sealing) is the initial white paper for the attestation and sealing techniques now offered by SGX. 

- [Attestation Service for Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX): API Documentation](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/7e/3b/ias-api-spec.pdf) provides the reference on how to interact with Intel Attestation Service using RESTful API.

- [Enhanced Privacy ID: A Direct Anonymous Attestation Scheme with Enhanced Revocation Capabilities](https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/194.pdf) is the initial paper from Intel that proposes Enhanced Privacy ID, the anonymous attestation scheme that is adopted by Intel Attestation Service.

- [Integrating Remote Attestation with Transport Layer Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05863.pdf) introcudes how to use remote attestation to achieve a TLS connection.

- [This blog from Intel](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/086.pdf) introduces the primitives associated with SGX sealing process. [More details](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/702997) are also available from SGX developer guide.


From Others
----

- [Intel SGX Explained](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/086.pdf) is a comprehensive introduction to the technology, including the architecture background and the implementation. A must-have.

- [Trust is in the Keys of the Beholder: Extending SGX Autonomy and Anonymity](https://www.idc.ac.il/en/schools/cs/research/Documents/jackson-msc-thesis.pdf) is the dissertation for MS degree by Alon Jackson. It offers an extensive description of the SGX ecosystem and evaluations of SGX security guarentees.
